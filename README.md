# Tic Time
A revolutionary time system based on the orbit of the sun.

## Units
Here are the basic units and their exact measurements in standard time, along with the unit equivalent:

1 Megatic (M) = 365.25 Days ~ Year

1 Licotic (L) = 36.525 Days ~ Month

1 Kilotic (K) = 3.6525 Days ~ 3 1/2 Days

1 Hectotic (H) = .36525 Days = 8.766 Hours = 526 Minutes ~ 1/3 Day

1 Decatic (Da) = .036525 Days = 52.6 Minutes ~ Hours

1 Tic (T) = .0036525 Days = 5.26 Minutes ~ 5 1/4 Minutes

1 Decitic (Di) = .536 Minutes = 32.16 Seconds ~ 1/2 minute

1 Centitic (C) = .0536 Minutes = 3.216 Seconds ~ Second

These names are derived from the metric names (Excluding Licotic, where the root Lico- is new root meaning 10,000. This is because there is no official root between Kilo- and Mega-. In this case, we created the root Lico- because L is after K and before M.)

## Date Format
The date is written as M . L K H

So May 21st, 2021 11:00 am would be 21.387

## Time Format
The time is written as  De . T Di C

So 1:31:3 AM  could be 1.753 (Maybe. Because of the nature of Tic Time, the time is dependent upon the date.)
